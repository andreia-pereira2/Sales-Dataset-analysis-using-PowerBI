# Sales Data Analysis & Visualization with Power BI

## 📊 Project Overview
In this project, I worked on an **Excel Sales dataset** to analyze and visualize sales data using **Power BI**. This dataset provides insights into various aspects of sales performance, including revenue trends, profitability, and regional performance.

## 🔍 Key Visualizations
To enhance data interpretation, I created several visualizations:
- **Horizontal Bar Chart**: Displays the sum of sales by **category and segment**.
- **Map Chart**: Highlights **profit by country** for a geographical perspective.
- **Line Charts**: Analyze **sales and profit trends by year** to understand growth patterns.

## 📈 Insights & Findings
From the data analysis, here are some key takeaways:
- **Technology** had the highest sales among all categories, with **Consumer Segment** leading the revenue share.
- **Sales and Profit** have shown a steady increase over the years, indicating positive growth trends.
- **Germany and France** were among the most profitable countries, whereas some regions had lower profitability and require further investigation.

## 🛠️ How to Use This Project
1. **Download the Power BI file** from this repository.
2. Open it using **Power BI Desktop**.
3. Explore the **interactive dashboards** to filter and analyze the data.
4. Gain insights from the visualizations and use them for decision-making.
